## Cloudbuild 
 
In the context of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Kubernetes clusters, cloudbuild.yaml comes into play when you want to build and push container images to Google Container Registry (GCR) as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Here's how it fits into the overall workflow:

Local Development: You use Skaffold for local development, which handles building, pushing, and deploying your application to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster (e.g., GKE cluster on GCP).

Continuous Integration/Deployment: When you're ready to deploy your application to a production or staging environment, you typically use a CI/CD pipeline. In GCP, you can use Cloud Build, which is a fully-managed CI/CD platform.

Cloud Build Configuration: The cloudbuild.yaml file defines the steps that Cloud Build should execute to build and push your container images to GCR. It can include steps for building the Docker images, running tests, and pushing the images to GCR.

Deployment to GKE: After the images are built and pushed to GCR, you can use Skaffold or other deployment tools (e.g., kubectl, Google Cloud Deploy) to deploy the application to a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster using the images from GCR.

In summary, Skaffold is primarily used for local development, providing an efficient workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster. When you're ready to deploy to a production or staging environment on GCP, you can use Cloud Build with a cloudbuild.yaml configuration to build and push your container images to GCR, and then use those images to deploy your application to a GKE cluster.

Let me provide some code snippets to make the explanations more concrete.

**Skaffold Configuration (`skaffold.yaml`):**

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v2beta22
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: my-backend
    context: backend
  - image: my-frontend
    context: frontend
deploy:
  kubectl:
    manifests:
    - k8s/*.yaml
dev:
  sync:
    infer: true # Specify the sync mode here
```

In this `skaffold.yaml` configuration, the `build` section defines the artifacts (container images) to be built, and the `deploy` section specifies the Kubernetes manifests to be used for deployment. The `dev.sync.infer` field sets the sync mode to `infer` for local development.

**Kubernetes Manifests (`k8s/backend.yaml`):**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: my-backend # Image built by Skaffold
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

This Kubernetes manifest defines a Deployment for the backend component, which will use the `my-backend` image built by Skaffold.

**Cloud Build Configuration (`cloudbuild.yaml`):**

```yaml
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-backend', 'backend']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-frontend', 'frontend']
images:
- 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-backend'
- 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-frontend'
```

In this `cloudbuild.yaml` configuration, Cloud Build is instructed to build two Docker images (`my-backend` and `my-frontend`) from the respective directories (`backend` and `frontend`) and push them to Google Container Registry (GCR).

**Local Development Workflow:**

1. Start Skaffold in development mode: `skaffold dev`
2. Make changes to `backend/src/main.go`
3. Skaffold detects the change, rebuilds the `my-backend` image, and syncs the updated files to the running containers using the specified sync mode (`infer` in this case).

**CI/CD Workflow:**

1. Commit and push changes to a version control system (e.g., GitHub).
2. Cloud Build triggers a new build based on the `cloudbuild.yaml` configuration.
3. Cloud Build builds and pushes the `my-backend` and `my-frontend` images to GCR.
4. Use Skaffold, `kubectl`, or other deployment tools to deploy the application to a GKE cluster using the images from GCR.
